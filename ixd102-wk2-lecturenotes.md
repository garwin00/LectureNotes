## A technique for producing ideas:
              
- Gathering the Raw Material - gather as much as you can
- Digesting the Material. - Work through it.
- Unconscious Processing. - Subconscious is always processing material. 
- The A-Ha moment. - Happens when you're least expcting it, keep a notebook nearby. 
- Idea Meets Reality. - Get honest opinions from people who aren't designers.
