## James Victore

juxtaposed with JMB - really just getting the message out with blunt terms.

- "Learn the rules then break them"
- "Don't decorate crap"
- "There are no ugly typefaces, only ugly designers."
- "There is no right font"
- "Sometimes the wrongest type choice is the best type choice"
- "Avoid any trick available from  pull-down menu"
- "Technology is not the answer - you are the answer"
- "Avoid trends. Create your own style and stop following the herd."
- "Feck Perfunction"
- "Following the rules makes your work look live everyone else's"
