# The Influence of Modern Art

## Cubism

Led by Picasso initially, had a keen interest in African art.

Cezanne influenced by work being broken into planes.

They brought what they were seeing around them into posters.

Geometric and graphic in approach.

**Roy Lichtenstein** - influenced by comic books.

**David Hockney** - takes the idea of cubism and takes it into photographs.

## Plakatstil

Art Nouveau in full flow, people expected to see that but this was shockingly bold.

**Lucien Bernhard** 1883 - 1972.

Known as "poster style". It's very simple and minimal. Flat design and approach. No flowers and decorative elements, just straight to the point.

He also designed typefaces.

Hans Rudi Erdt contributed to the movement that Bernhard started.

### Contemporary Approaches

Flat, minimal style and colours. Apple used it for first iPod campaign.

**Albert Exergian** - series of reduced TV posters.

## WW1

Posters were trying to get people to sign up to get involved in the war process.

Germans placed particular emphasis on atrocities committed.  

Propaganda was *very* successful.

### Contemporary Approaches

Playing on that link to the past, it still has an effect today.

**Marko Manev** - Designer from Macedonia.

## Futurism

Originated in Italy. Marinetti embraced the Industrial Revolution and looked at abstract concepts of time and movement, the Winged Samothrace seen as masterpiece.
